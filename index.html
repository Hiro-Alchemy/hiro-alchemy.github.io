<p> I'm Garrett Canepa.
<br>
I am a Graphic Design student at San Jose State University. In my classes, I work in many mediums including posters, icons, logos, brochures, and pamphlets.
<br>
Outside of my classes, I also work with twitch emotes, profile pictures, social media banners, as well as Illustrations and designs more broadly. I also often like to experiment in other creative and artistic mediums.
 (Please contact me if you would like something drawn or designed.)
 <br>
I am a Free Speech Warrior and a Liberty Activist. I am also the proud president of the San Jose State chapter of Young Americans For Liberty.
As an artist, I feel like It is important to protect your right to express yourself   and speak your mind, even if I completely disagree with your message or philosophy. In this, I hope that you will want to protect MY right to do the same so I can continue to create art and express myself.
